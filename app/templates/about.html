            <h2>Multimodal Knowledge-Enhanced Prescriptive Maintenance with Explainable AI and Adaptive RAG</h2>

            <p>
                This is an advanced independent research and development project by <strong>Md. Ehsanul Haque Kanan</strong>. It demonstrates an end-to-end, intelligent system for <strong>Prescriptive Maintenance (PdM)</strong>, evolving beyond traditional predictive models by integrating a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system moves from simply predicting <em>when</em> an asset might fail to prescribing <em>how to fix it</em>, using a conversational AI assistant grounded in a custom knowledge base of technical manuals and maintenance logs.

            <h3>Core Objectives:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prescriptive Power:</strong> To move beyond prediction by using a RAG pipeline and a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide technicians with actionable, step-by-step guidance for diagnostics and repairs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conversational AI:</strong> To enable users to interact with the system using natural language. <strong>The "Troubleshooting Assistant" on each asset's detail page serves as the direct interface to the dynamic knowledge base,</strong> allowing users to ask complex questions and receive precise, context-aware answers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Knowledge-Enhanced Decisions:</strong> To create a dynamic knowledge base from unstructured text (manuals, logs) using a vector database (ChromaDB), enhancing the AI's reasoning capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adaptivity (Human-in-the-Loop):</strong> To build a system designed for continuous learning by capturing user feedback on AI-generated responses, creating a path for future model fine-tuning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Explainable AI (XAI):</strong> To maintain trust by using SHAP to provide clear, human-understandable explanations for the underlying predictive models (RUL and Fault Classification).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>End-to-End MLOps:</strong> To demonstrate a complete, production-ready workflow, from data ingestion and model training to a containerized (Docker) web application.
                </li>
            </ul>
